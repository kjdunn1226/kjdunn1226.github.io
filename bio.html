                <p>
                        I'm a student at Tufts University with a double major in <br/>
                        computer science and child study &amp; human development. My <br/>
                        personal attributes are my patience, kindness, work ethic, and <br/>
                        ability to connect the significance of small things to bigger <br/>
                        ideas. In my free time, I like to run, read, listen to music, <br/>
                        watch YouTube videos, and talk to people. I am currently in the <br/>
                        process of looking for an internship for the summer of 2017 in <br/>
                        human services related to behavioral health and education. I <br/>
                        think it's fascinating how our minds develop as we get older <br/>
                        and how the way we think can provide advantages and disadvantages <br/>
                        unique to each individual. Even though I want to work in human <br/>
                        services, I also love programming because it exercises a different <br/>
                        part of my mind, and it has the potential to come in handy in my <br/>
                        life and career.
